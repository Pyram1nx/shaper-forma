# Shaper forma

A lightweight, fully client-side design studio for the Shaper Origin, modelled on
Shaper Tools' Studio (layout, colours, IBM Plex Sans type, Design / Plan / Review
modes), with two extras:

- **3D Carve:** drop in an STL / OBJ / GLB model, pick a bit from the gallery, and
  it slices the model into layers. For each layer it calculates the cut depth and the
  bit-compensated offset, so V-bits, ball noses and bull noses leave the model's
  surface instead of gouging it.
- **Paper Scan:** photograph a sketch on paper, pick the paper size, and the
  page is flattened and the pen lines are vectorised into **real-size** paths.

Everything runs on your computer. Designs are saved as files you control. The editor
works without an account; an optional account (email and password) is available when
the build is configured with an accounts API.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| Design | Pen tool, Make Shape (circle, ellipse, rectangle, rounded rect, polygon, triangle + 14 templates), text to outlines (IBM Plex Sans or your own font), SVG import (hidden layers skipped, local `<use>` resolved, unsupported content reported), move / scale / rotate / anchor, smart-alignment snapping, Offset (open paths are stroked), ShapeShifter (union, subtract, intersect, exclude), mirror, duplicate (copies get their own groups), z-order, lock / unlock all. Units (in or mm) are set per design in the settings menu, and new designs start in the last unit you chose. |
| Plan | Cut type (on line, guide, inside, pocket, outside), depth, offset, bit diameter (⅛ ¼ ½ presets + bit library), live tool-width preview. The cut path can be shown for every shape (Cut path display setting), drawn as marching cut paths. Units are also switchable here. |
| Review | Depth-shaded material preview |
| Files | Autosave + Open Recent (browser storage), **Save / Open `.shaperstudio` files on your computer** (writes back to the same file in Chrome / Edge), Export SVG for Origin. New, Open, Import and Open Recent ask before discarding unsaved changes. |
| 3D Carve | STL/OBJ/GLB/GLTF, units + up-axis + fit-to-size, Shaper's real catalogue of 20 bits (`docs/research/shaper-bits.json`, including the 3 that come in the box), step-down / layers / stock / margin, per-layer contour (guide) + compensated toolpath (on line) + pocket region (pocket), optional through-cut |
| Paper Scan | Camera or photo upload, automatic paper corner detection with draggable corners, A3/A4/A5/Letter/Legal/Tabloid/custom, lighting correction, adaptive ink threshold, centerline or outline tracing, stroke-width estimate |

### How cuts are encoded in the SVG

Exported SVGs are real size (`width`/`height` in mm) and use Shaper's conventions.
Cut type is encoded both as fill/stroke colour and as `shaper:cutType`, and depth is
written as `shaper:cutDepth`. Guides are blue strokes.

Cut offsets are **baked into the exported geometry**: outside grows the shape by the
offset, inside and pocket shrink it, and on-line moves closed paths outward. The
exported path is the path the bit edge follows, so no offset attribute is needed. The
3D Carve toolpaths follow the same rule, since they are the exact path the bit centre
must take for the chosen bit.

### 3D Carve maths (short version)

The model is sliced at sampled depths. For a layer with tip depth `dᵢ`, `S(d)` is the
slice of the model that must remain at depth `d`, and `reach(h)` is the bit's cutting
radius at height `h` above its tip. The bit centre must stay outside everything that
is still standing above it. Taking every sampled depth `δ ≤ dᵢ`:

```
Forbiddenᵢ = ⋃ over sampled δ ≤ dᵢ of  offset(S(δ), reach(dᵢ − δ))
```

For a flat end mill this reduces to "offset by the radius". For a V-bit or ball nose
the flank is accounted for at every sampled height in the layer. The boundary of
`Forbiddenᵢ` is exported as an *on-line* toolpath. The pocket region is

```
pocketᵢ = stock − offset(Forbiddenᵢ, −r_top) − S(dᵢ)
```

where `r_top` is the bit's reach at the top of the layer, so the pocket never removes
material that has to stay. Layers are cut shallow first.

## Develop

Requires Node 22 (see `.nvmrc`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build      # type-check + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
npm test           # unit tests (vitest): geometry, editor state, SVG and project file I/O
```

## Desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux)

The editor also ships as a native app built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app). The Rust
shell lives in `src-tauri/`.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev       # run the desktop app with hot reload
npm run tauri build     # build an installer for this machine
```

Building needs Rust 1.90 or newer (`rustup update stable`). On Linux, install the
WebKitGTK packages listed in the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

### Home window

The desktop app opens to a home window. It lists the designs saved on this computer
(newest first, with a thumbnail), starts new designs, and has the account page. Opening
a design, or using **Designs** in the studio's app menu, shows the studio in its own
window. A design that is already open in the studio is switched to in place. In a
browser the same screens open as tabs (`?view=home`).

### Releases and updates

- Pushing a tag such as `v0.2.0` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It builds macOS
  (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows and Linux, and publishes a GitHub Release.
- The release notes come from the matching `## <version>` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
- The app checks the latest release every time it opens. If there is a newer version it
  shows the release notes on request and asks before downloading and installing.
- Update packages are signed with a Tauri updater key. The private key is stored only as
  the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secret. The public key is in
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
- Before a release, bump `version` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `package.json`,
  and add a changelog section.

### Accounts

Accounts are optional. Set `VITE_API_URL` at build time to the base URL of an accounts
API (see `server/index.mjs`). Without it, accounts are disabled and everything else works.
